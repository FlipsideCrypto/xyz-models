{% docs core__fact_blocks %}

This table contains "block" level data for the Aptos blockchain. This table can be used to analyze trends at a block level, for example total transactions over time.
"The Aptos blockchain doesn't have an explicit notion of a block — it only uses blocks for batching and executing transactions.
A transaction at height 0 is the first transaction (genesis transaction), and a transaction at height 100 is the 101st transaction in the transaction store."
