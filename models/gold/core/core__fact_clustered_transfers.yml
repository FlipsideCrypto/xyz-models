    description: |-
      Bitcoin transfers between unrelated clustered entities. This table updates daily around 00:00 UTC after our clustering process. 
      Note that records (from entity, to entity) in this table are expected to change as addresses are clustered and re-clustered on a daily basis. Previously ungrouped transfers may be flattened into singular transfers as addresses are clustered together. 
      Read more on our clustering process in the bitcoin-models repository (https://github.com/FlipsideCrypto/bitcoin-models/tree/main/models/silver/labels/clustering).
